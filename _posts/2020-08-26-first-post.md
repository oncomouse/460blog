Welcome to the ENGL 460 blog for Fall 2020.

My name is Andrew Pilsch (he/him). I live in Bryan, was born in Riverside, CA, but grew up with parents in the Air Force, so I've lived all over (including Portugal). My favorite movie is *Mad Max: Fury Road*; my favorite book is *Neuromancer* by William Gibson; my favorite video game is *The Secret of Monkey Island*; my 5 favorite songs are "Move on Up" by Curtis Mayfield, "Hounds of Love" by Kate Bush, "Once in a Lifetime" by Talking Heads, "This Year" by The Mountain Goats, and "Moth to a Flame" by Chairlift. My favorite album of 2020 (so far) is *After Hours* by The Weeknd. My favorite taco is Eggs, Potatoes, Beans and Cheese.
